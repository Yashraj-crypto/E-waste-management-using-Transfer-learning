# E-waste-management-using-Transfer-learning
This is a project on management of E-waste , for which machine learning is used. VGG16 is used for the transfer learning.

We have created a model to detect 8 classes of major ewaste hardware.
The goal of this project is to automate the task of segregation of E-Waste in the vast process of recycling and refurbishment of these harware components. This system aims to provide high speed and efficient working in the ewaste sector
